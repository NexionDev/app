# Getting Started

Welcome to **Nexion** — the next-generation Web3 SSH manager! This guide will help you get started in 5 minutes and experience the revolution of decentralized server management.

## 🚀 What is Nexion?

Nexion is an innovative SSH management tool that:
- **Replaces traditional SSH keys with crypto wallets** for enhanced security

## 📱 Step 1: Install a Web3 Wallet

### What is a Web3 Wallet?

A Web3 wallet is your digital identity and asset management tool, similar to a traditional bank card but more secure:
- **Private keys are fully under your control**, no need to trust third parties
- **Supports multiple cryptocurrencies**, including OKB, ETH, and more
- **One wallet for multi-platform use**, compatible with both mobile and desktop

### Recommended Wallet: OKX

We recommend using **OKX ecosystem products**, which include complete exchange and wallet functionality:

#### Option 1: OKX Main App (Recommended for beginners)
Includes exchange + wallet functionality, suitable for users who need to purchase OKB:

### Beginner Wallet Setup Tutorial

#### Step 2: Backup Seed Phrase (Extremely Important!)
1. **Record seed phrase**: Write down the 12 English words with pen and paper
2. **Store securely**: Keep in a safe place, don't take screenshots or store in cloud
3. **Verify seed phrase**: Click words in the prompted order for verification

> ⚠️ **Important Reminder**: The seed phrase is the only way to recover your wallet. Losing the seed phrase = losing your assets!

#### Step 3: Get OKB Tokens

##### For blockchain beginners: Purchase through OKX Exchange

1. **Buy USDT with fiat currency**
   ```
   OKX Homepage → "Buy Crypto" → Select USDT → Enter amount → Choose payment method
   ```

3. **Transfer to wallet address**
   ```
   Assets → OKB → Withdraw → Enter wallet address → Select X Layer network → Confirm transfer
   ```

##### For blockchain veterans: Direct transfer
If you already have OKB or other tokens, you can:
- Transfer OKB from other exchanges to your wallet address
- Use cross-chain bridges to convert assets from other chains to OKB on X Layer
- Exchange other tokens for OKB through DEX

#### Step 4: Switch to X Layer Network

Nexion runs on **X Layer** blockchain, so you need to switch networks:

1. **Open wallet settings**
   ```
   Wallet homepage → Network name in top-right → Add network
   ```

2. **Switch to X Layer**
   - After successful addition, select X Layer as the current network
   - Ensure your OKB is on the X Layer network

## 📥 Step 2: Install Nexion

### Download App

Visit our [Installation Guide](/docs/installation) to download the version suitable for your system:
- **macOS** - Released, supports Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Windows/Linux** - In development, coming soon

### Why is Nexion More Secure?

**Problems with traditional SSH management:**
- Private key files are easily lost or stolen
- Configurations stored locally, difficult to sync
- Password authentication vulnerable to brute force attacks
- Unable to track access history

**Nexion's Web3 solution:**
- **Wallet signature authentication**: Uses cryptographic-level digital signatures, thousands of times more secure than traditional passwords
- **Blockchain storage**: Configurations encrypted and stored on decentralized networks, never lost
- **Decentralized identity**: Your wallet address is your identity, no need to register accounts
- **Traceable operations**: All operations recorded on blockchain, complete audit history

## 🔗 Step 3: Connect Wallet

### Connection Process

When starting Nexion for the first time:

1. **Click "Connect Wallet"**
   - App will automatically detect available wallets
   - Recommend using OKX Wallet

2. **Select wallet type**
   ```
   OKX Wallet (Recommended) - Optimized for OKB ecosystem
   MetaMask - Widely used Ethereum wallet
   WalletConnect - Supports multiple mobile wallets
   ```

3. **Authorize connection**
   - Wallet will pop up connection request
   - Click "Connect" to authorize app access

4. **Identity verification signature**
   - App requests signature for identity verification
   - Signing is free and doesn't consume tokens
   - Click "Sign" to complete identity binding

### How Do We Use Your Wallet?

**Nexion's wallet-based implementation:**

1. **Identity Authentication**
   ```
   Wallet signature = Identity verification
   Wallet address = Unique user ID, no need to register accounts
   ```

2. **Configuration Management**
   ```
   Supports both password and private key SSH authentication methods
   Adding/modifying configurations requires wallet signature confirmation
   ```

3. **Data Encrypted Storage**
   ```
   Configuration info → Wallet signature encryption → Upload to blockchain
   Retrieve config → Decrypt based on signature → Display to user
   Only your wallet can decrypt your own configurations
   ```

4. **Fee Structure**
   ```
   Paid operations: Registration, adding configs, modifying configs (one-time OKB fee)
   Free operations: Query configs, SSH connections, FTP transfers (no fees)
   No subscription model, pay-as-you-go
   ```

**Security Guarantees:**
- 🔐 **Wallet signature encryption**: Configurations encrypted using signature results, absolutely secure
- 🛡️ **Private keys never leave wallet**: Nexion cannot access your private keys
- 📝 **Auditable operations**: All valuable interactions recorded on blockchain
- ⚡ **Decentralized storage**: Configurations stored on blockchain, never lost
